# Sound-Assignment
This is an assignment for games design where I created visuals for sounds using my electric guitar as the input. This was a team project for first year of Games Design. The original Repository is

# What is the project about
Purpose of the progect was to make a sketch that interacts to musinc or sound.
Myself and my partner opted with using an electric guitar as an input and to manipulate designs using the guitar.

Used Fast Fourier Transform to measure frequceny more accurately as opposed to using the zero-crossing method (how many times the sin wave passes through the mid point of 0).

The sketch is split into two sections

1: A short game

2: Flow State Mode


# Short Game
We created this game in order to allow the player use their guitar as a controller.
The game is a duck shooter where ducks fly downwards to the fret and the player must play the note according to where the duck is positioned.

We are using the 1st string on the guitar as the controller.
The goal of the game is to attempt to recieve the highest score and to prevent the ducks from flying all the way down to toch the fret.

# Flow State Mode
This is the main part of the sketch.
In this you go through various scenes and using the guitar to pass through each scene.

The scenes consists of a solar system where planets revolves around the sun and as you play the guitar the sun shrinks to the point where a black hole emerges and eats the other planets. You have to continue playing the guitar to constantly feed the black holes and let it grow larger.
A calming music is played in the background as you progress

Then after this scene you enter the music part of the project where a dubstep music is played and based on the beats of the song, shapes pulsate to it. Also the guitar is still used to create some affects.

In this stage the user can press 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 to go through 4 modes of visualisation


### What are these visualisation modes?
1: A 3D shape of pyramids and spheres starting big then grows small inside of each other
Playing the guitar inverts the image. As the music continues, each poweful beat changes the colour and pulsates the shapes

2: Cubed Corners. In this 3D cubes fly from the 4 corners into each other. Each beat changes the colour and pulsates the shapes.

3: Mountain Creation.
In this a 2.5D plane is played in the background and split into meshes. Each beat changes the colour of the plane. When the guitar is played mountains and hills start to form. the smoother you play the guitar the smoother are the "mountains". However the harder and louder you play the sharper and taller the "mountains become".

4: Flower and Bubble mode.
In this everytime you play the guitar bubbles appear on the screen randomly and flowers begin to spin on random points on the screen.
